# Regex Tutorial

A regex, or "regular expression," is a versatile way of defining specific search patterns. Regular expressions are sequences of characters that, with a few language-specific adjustments to the syntax, can be used in most programming languages to find characters, sequences and patterns within strings. In addition to executing "find" or "find and replace" functions in search algorithms, regular expressions are also frequently used for input validation.
